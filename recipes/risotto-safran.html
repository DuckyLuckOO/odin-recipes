    <h2>The Risotto safran is an Italian recipe with risotto rice and safran</h2>
    <h3> Ingredients</h3>
    <ul> Cooking
        <li>	250 g Riz Carnaroli</li>
        <li>250g Butter</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>2g Saffron</li>
        <li>1L Vegetable broth</li>
        <li>1 Glass of dry white wine</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>Reading
        <li>75g Butter</li>
        <li>80g Greated Parmesan</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>To prepare the saffron risotto, first infuse the saffron pistils to release all the aromas. In a glass, pour a little hot water and place the saffron pistils in it. Leave to rest for at least 1 hour and at best overnight.</li>
        <li>Then prepare the vegetable broth, a liter of which is needed for the recipe.</li>
        <li>Peel and finely chop the onion (or shallot) so that it can melt well during cooking. In a large saucepan, pour 50 g of butter and melt it over low heat. Pour in the chopped onion and leave to brown for 10-15 minutes, adding broth to prevent the stir-fry from drying out: the onion should be transparent and tender.</li>
        <li>Once the onion is well browned, pour in the rice and grill it for 3-4 minutes, so that the grains weld together and continue to cook. Add the white wine and let it evaporate completely.</li>
        <li>Once the rice is well toasted, continue cooking for about 18-20 minutes, adding the very hot broth one ladle at a time, as it is absorbed by the rice: the grains should always be covered. 5 minutes before the end of cooking, pour in the water with the saffron pistils that you have infused, stir well to give the risotto a golden color.</li>
        <li>When the risotto is cooked, turn off the heat and add the grated parmesan and the 75 g of cold butter. Stir energetically to properly incorporate and bind all the ingredients. Leave to rest for a minute before serving on a plate, decorate with a few pistils of saffron. Enjoy!</li>
